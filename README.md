# Employee API Integration
This web application project was created for fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other. This app was created by integrating data from https://randomuser.me/ API which is an API for generating random users. 

# script.js
This is the main JavaScript file which uses fetch API for the integreation, and parsing,DOM manipulation. Fetch API is used to integrated with the server asynchronously which then returns promises in order to handle the completed ashnchronus operations, then the data is parsed so that the properties can be accessed with JavaScript, and finally the parsed data is inserted into the DOM in order to render the employee information on the cards.
